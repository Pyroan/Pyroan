# ![Hello This Is My Gitted Hubbed](./header.svg)
## Things you'll find here:
- Neat/artsy visualizations of algorithms, [functions](https://github.com/pyroan/GravMap), and delicious delicious [data](https://github.com/Pyroan/AdventOfCode2021#visualizations)
- [Jokes](https://github.com/pyroan/Unilang) that spiralled out of control
- Lil baby lil [indie games](https://pyroan.itch.io/)
- Other rapidly prototyped experimental [byproducts](https://github.com/Pyroan/stringtheory) of my ephemeral hyperfocus
- Just an unreasonable amount of obfuscated code and [code golf](https://github.com/Pyroan/AdventOfCode2022/blob/master/day9/day9golf.py)
- The very occasional actual useful [tool](https://github.com/Pyroan/love-build)
- A lot of vaporware <3

## ⚠️IF YOU CLONED ANY OF THESE REPOSITORIES BEFORE DECEMBER 21ST, 2022... ⚠️
I am *so* sorry about this, but there was an extremely important change that needed to be made to the git history of every repo predating roughly Spring of 2021, so if you cloned any of those affected (see below) before **December 21st, 2022**, you'll need to get a fresh clone of it before any new pushes/merges/PRs can be accepted.
