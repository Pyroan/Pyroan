## Things you'll find here:
- Neat/artsy visualizations of algorithms, [functions](https://github.com/pyroan/GravMap), and delicious delicious [data](https://github.com/Pyroan/AdventOfCode2021#visualizations)
- [Jokes](https://github.com/pyroan/Unilang) that spiralled out of control
- Other rapidly prototyped experimental [byproducts](https://github.com/Pyroan/stringtheory) of my ephemeral hyperfocus
- Just an unreasonable amount of obfuscated code and [code golf](https://github.com/Pyroan/AdventOfCode2022/blob/master/day9/day9golf.py)
- The very occasional actual useful [tool](https://github.com/Pyroan/love-build)
- A lot of vaporware <3
